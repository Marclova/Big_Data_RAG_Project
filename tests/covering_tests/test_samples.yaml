text_to_cluster: "Generically defined, recommender systems can be characterized as software solutions that provide users convenient access\nto relevant content. The types of conveniences that such systems provide can be manifold. Historically, recommender\nsystems were mainly designed as information filtering tools, like the early GroupLens system [62] from 1994. Later\non, various other ways were investigated how such systems can create value, e.g., by helping users discover relevant\ncontent, by providing easy access to related content (e.g., accessories), or by even taking automatic action like creating\nand starting a music playlist.\nWhile a recommender systems can serve various purposes and create value in different ways [40], the predominant\n(implicit) objective of recommender systems in literature today can be described as “guide users to relevant items in\nsituations of information overload”, or simply “find good items” [26]. The most common way of operationalizing this\ninformation filtering problem is to frame the recommendation task as a supervised machine learning problem. The\ncore of this problem is to learn a function from noisy data, which accurately predicts the relevance of a given item for\nindividual users, sometimes also taking contextual factors into account.\nAlthough the actual relevance of recommended items can be assessed in different ways [25], data-based offline\nexperiments dominate the research landscape.
