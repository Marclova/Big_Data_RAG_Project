    Increases the given id, which is supposed to be a string of digits and lowercase letters, by one.\n
    The applied increment includes a carry operation, so that the id is always a string of digits and lowercase letters.\n
    The returned id may be longer than the original one by one character, which in that case will be completely filled with '0's.\n
    This method may also work with ids containing characters that are not digits nor lowercase letters,
